# The Command Line

**A command line, or terminal**, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard 
and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

example for command

```
1. **user@bash: ls -l /home/ryan
2. total 3
3. drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
4. drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
5. drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html
6. user@bash:
```

### The shell 
This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands

### the basic commands

* **pwd** Print Working Directory It tells you what your current or present working directory is
* **ls** short for list to know what what in the directory 

## Path 

there are 2 types of path 

1. Absolute
Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory
2. Relative
Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system

**More on paths**

* ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory
* . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory. eg in the example above we referred to Documents on line 4 with a relative path.
* .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory
* cd which stands for change directory
* **file** obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* ls -a is a contents of directory
* everything is a file in linux

* Linux is Case Sensitive

* Linux actually has a very simple and elegant mechanism for specifying that a file or directory is hidden. If the file or directory's name begins with a . (full stop) 
  then it is considered to be hidden.
