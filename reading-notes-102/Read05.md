## Comparison Operators

Evaluate a situation by **comparing a value** in the script to what expected might be,

the result will be true or false **Boolean**
* `==` is equal to 
**this operator compare two values to check if they are the same value (not the data type)**
> 'Hello' == 'Hello' **true** --- 3 == '3' **true**

* `!=` is not equal to
**this operator compare two values to check if they are not the same value (not the data type)**
> 'Hello' != 'Hello` **false**

* `===` Strict equal to 
**this operator compare two values to check if they are the same value and data type**

> '3' === 3 **false** they are not the same data type

* `!==` Strict not equal to
**this operator compare two values to check if they are not the same value and data type**

> '3' !== 3 **true** they are not the same data type

* `>` Greater than
**this operator check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right**

> 5 > 2 **true**

* `<` Less than
this operator check if the number on the left is less than the number on the right
> 2 < 5 **true**

* `>=` Greater than or equal to
**this operator check if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right**
> 5 >= 2 **true**

* `<=` Less than or equal to
**this operator check if the number on the left is less than or equal the number on the right**
> 2 <= 5 **true**

## Logical Operators

the logical oerators allow to compare more than one **comparison oprerator**

> (5 < 2) && ( 2 >= 3)
> false  and  false will result **false**

* type of logical operators
1. `&&` **and**
2. `||` **or**
3. `!` **not**

## LOOPS

loop will check a condition and if it returns true the code will run, the condition will be checked again of its true the code
will run again until its return false

### types of loops

* **FOR** 
we use FOR when need to run the code for a specific number of time

* **WHILE**
we use WHILE when we dont know how many times to run the code

* **DO WHILE**
the same ass while but it will run the statments atleast once even if the condition false

**loop counters** uses a counter as a condition to run the code for a specified number of time and its need the intilization and condition and the update
