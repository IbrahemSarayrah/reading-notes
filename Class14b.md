## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

* **our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our 
cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, 
psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition 
to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of 
themselves.**

* **software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, 
see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to 
achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction**

* **Google became focused on building the perfect team,In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle 
to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared,The researchers eventually concluded that 
what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other 
words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the 
members were exceptionally bright.** 

* **the technology industry is not just one of the fastest growing parts of our economy; it is also increasingly the world’s dominant commercial culture**

* **Google’s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, 
members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.**
