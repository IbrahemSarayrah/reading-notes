## Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

* The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control.

* When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

* Rendering: is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website.

* Templates: In programming, a template is a generic class or other unit of source code that can be used as the basis for unique units of code.

* State: a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.

## What Is JSX?

* JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code.

* The syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors to transform HTML-like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will parse.

* by using JSX you can write concise HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM like tree structures) in the same file as you write JavaScript code.
