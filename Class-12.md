| -----------  | ----------- |
|   SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases  | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database |
|   SQL databases are table based databases   | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
|   SQL databases have predefined schema   | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
|   SQL databases are vertically scalable   | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable |
|   SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data   | NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents |

#### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

* SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment

* Example for SQL database **MS-SQL Server Express Edition** and It is a powerful and user friendly database which has good stability, reliability and scalability with support from Microsoft

#### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

* NoSQL database are good fit and better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

* Example for NoSQL database **Mongodb**  is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents.

#### Which type of database is best for scalability?

* SQL , and its vertically scalable and SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware.

#### What does SQL stand for?

* Structured Query Language

#### What is a realational database?

* is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

#### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
