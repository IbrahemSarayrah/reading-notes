# How Computers Works

* Computers Designed to control information
* Computer Task to :
> 1. Input like using the keyboard and mouse 
> 2. Store information all the input give the information to store it in memory then send it to 
> process the information and send back the processed information back to be stored
> 3. output the computer continues processing the information until its ready to output using display as text audio or video

## Binary and Data

the computer have electric wires and circuits that carry all the information using the bits
that carry information on the form of `1 and 0` the more bits the computer have the more 
complex the information the bit called **binary number system** that only have 2 number `1 and 0`
and we use **binary number system** to represent any word or paragraph using sequence of numbers


## Circuits and Logic

* **circuits can modify and process information, input and give output and perform complex 
    to give resualt calculations**

## CPU

the central processing unit **cpu** all the calculations are processed in the cpu take information
from the memory and after processing go back to memory to be ready to the output


## Hardware and Software 

* **The hardware are every thing inside the computer including circuits,, chips, wires, plugs**

* **the software all of computer programs, or code that running on the computer and the software
     can be anything from apps to games and webpages and data**

* **CPU chip control all the part in the computer and handle specific tasks and send and receive information 
    from parts of the computer**

* **the binary code basic from of software that control all the hardware of the computer**

* **Software tell cpu what task to do through the operating system and contol other software and hardware**
